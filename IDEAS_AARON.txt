I hope this message finds you well.

I am reaching out to discuss a situation we are currently facing in our production environment (PROD). Recently, after a deployment, we generated Blackduck scans that returned critical results. In our efforts to regularize the PROD environment, we attempted to conduct the same scans in our lower environments; however, the results we obtained did not align with the critical findings from PROD.

This discrepancy in results has raised concerns for us, as it is crucial to understand the root of these differences and ensure that our environment is free from vulnerabilities.

I would greatly appreciate your support in determining what actions we can take in these situations. Any guidance, advice, or additional tools you could provide would be immensely helpful.

Thank you in advance for your attention and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
